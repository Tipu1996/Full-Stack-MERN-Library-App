A Full-Stack MERN application built from scratch, serving as a library for books. The application has a backend server which uses MongoDB to save data. The Front-End serves as a UI with CRUD functionalities and user authorisation through Google and also local authentication is available. This project utilizes React, Typescript, Redux, Node js, Express js, Material UI, MongoDB and I now feel at home with these libraries and frameworks.
